# SPDZ Support

You are an advanced Go programmer with security engineering
background. Analyze the attached protocol specification. Your task is
to implement the Peer function in the spdz.go file. Are the
instuctions complete? What additional infrastructure or library
functionality you would need?

# SPDZ Prompt Analysis

You are an LLM coding agent. Your task is to create program based on
the information in the attached contexts. Analyze the context
information from the implementation perspective. How could it be
improved? Is the overview clear enough?

# SPDZ Implementation

You are an advanced Go programmer with security engineering
background. Analyze the attached protocol specification. Your task is
to implement the Peer function in the spdz.go file. There exists a
`main.go` file with the `main` function. It creates the peers,
initializes their inputs, and runs the `Peer` function in
goroutines. Your task is to implement only the `Peer` function and any
support functions it needs.
